# VocabSubs2
VocabSubs2 is a program which generates subtitles for learning the Japanese language through subtitles containing word-to-word literal translations of existing Japanese subtitles, inspired by the subtitles proposed in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wF91iArEp0). The user must supply an existing Japanese subtitle file (timed to sentence or utterance precision), and VocabSubs2 spits out special subtitles.

Unlike in the YouTube video, VocabSubs2 does **not** output particles and other non-content words. This is **by design** in order to force intermediate viewers to listen to the audio and comprehend the grammar.

# Background
Basically, as each Japanese word is uttered in the video, the corresponding translation of that word is shown in the same word order as in Japanese, similar to an [Interlinear Gloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlinear_gloss). This requires the viewer to use their existing knowledge of Japanese grammar, while helping them associate vocabulary meanings to their pronunciation.

Compared to regular English translated subtitles, this prevents the viewer from taking the "path of least resistance" to their understanding, because simply reading the fully translated English subtitle requires no Japanese comprehension at all. At minimum, viewing the subtitles generated by VocabSubs2 requires the viewer to listen to the audio and comprehend the grammar.

A blog post describing how this works is forthcoming.

# Results
This project is only a proof-of-concept. It *does* work, and I personally think it helps you learn vocabulary. **However:**
* Certain words are misanalyzed grammatically. For example, names are sometimes translated literally instead of left as names.
* Certain words have verbose definitions that take up a lot of space in the subtitle.
* There are some occasional timing glitches. Nothing to render it unwatchable, but noticeable every so often.
* It's not very pretty. This is just an aesthetic thing, and could probably be fixed with an update fairly easily.
